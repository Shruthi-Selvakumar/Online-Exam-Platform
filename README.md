 Online Quiz Examination System is a web-based application for student evaluation.
This project fulfills the requirements of institutes to conduct exams online without relying on
other platforms for better personalization. The student who has to write the exam and the
corresponding faculty have to log in to the system with proper authentication from the
administrator. The administrator has the privilege to create accounts for the users and can
configure the subject. Various reports can be generated to view the results in a well-organized
manner to all the users.
